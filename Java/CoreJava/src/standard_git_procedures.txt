Here are the standard steps we can follow for doing Git stuff.

1. After every lesson, Jay will push the things just taught at that lesson from his local into remote master branch.

2. Normally, there will be a new homework in the "homework_instruction.txt" file for that lesson.

3. Matthew and Kyle do a pull to sync up their local master with remote master.

    git co master

    git pull

4. After you sync up local master with remote master, check out to your DEV branch.

    git co Matt-DEV

5. Merge your DEV branch with your local master.

    git merge master

6. Do your homework in your DEV branch.

7. After your homework is done, commit it to your DEV branch.

    git st

    git add .

    git cm -m "Some message about your homework"

    git tree

8. Create a new homework branch based on your just committed DEV branch.

    git co -b Matt-Hw99

    Note: Hw99 is a sequence placeholder, you can have Hw1, Hw2, Hw3, etc when you create more homework branches.

9. Push your new homework branch to remote.

    git push origin Matt-Hw99

10. Next lesson, we will repeat the steps from 1 to 9.
