How to create a Maven project:
==============================

1. Create an empty maven project by following

    a) select menu  File -> New -> Project...
    b) In the New Project window, select "Maven" from the left pane, and click Next button
    c) Choose a folder in the Location: dropdown
    d) Give a project name in the "Name:" input
    e) Expend the "Artifact Coordinates"

        For "GroupId:", fill anything you like, for example, org.grouplearning
        For "ArtifactId:", fill anything you like, for example, java-logging
        For "Version:" , you can keep the default, or you give any version you want.

    f) Click Finish button. A new Maven project will be created.

2). pom.xml (Project Object Model) is Maven file to manage the project dependencies and build info.

3). Open pom.xml file, click any empty space under </properties>, type <, then hit Ctrl + Space, it should pop up
    some option, select <dependencies>, and hit Tab key

    Or you can simply type:

        <dependencies>

        </dependencies>

4). Add following <dependency> within <dependencies>. You can use copy paste to add it. It should look like below when complete

        <dependency>
            <groupId>org.junit.jupiter</groupId>
            <artifactId>junit-jupiter-engine</artifactId>
            <version>5.5.2</version>
            <scope>test</scope>
        </dependency>

5). Right click anywhere in the "pom.xml" editor, select "Maven", then "Reload Project" from the popup
    menu. You should see the "junit" libraries on the left "Project Pane" under "External Libraries".


6)  Note: After copy/paste all the grouplearning corejava code here. I have to do a Maven clean and compile. Otherwise
    runtime error.
