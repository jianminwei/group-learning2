1. Properties belong to class. They are hoisted (means you can define them anywhere, even after where they are used).

2. Properties scope is defined by access modifier.

3. Variables belong to function (method).

4. Variables are function / block scoped; and they are not hoisted.

5. Because variables are function / block scoped, they don't need access modifier; Their maximum scope is inside the function or block.
